Welcome to circunvolution.42madrid.net in Madrid, SP.

A gyrus (plural: gyri) is a ridge on the surface of 
the brain. Each ridge is surrounded by fissures known
as sulci (singular: sulcus). Gyri are unique structures
that have an important evolutionary function; they 
increase the surface area of the brain up to an 
impressive 2000 centimeters squared.

This large surface area gives us better cognition without
having to increase the size of the brain, which is of 
course trapped within the skull and hence limited by size.

There are many specific gyri which are important to the 
brain’s functions. For example, the superior temporal 
gyrus contains the Wernicke’s area, which is vital in 
the computation of language, while the precentral gyrus
acts as the primary motor center of the brain.
